            2. Give her compliments.  Give your girlfriend praise. Show her that youre noticing her and you appreciate her. Dont just compliment her on her looks. Congratulate her on getting a new account at work, or tell her you admire her rock-climbing skills. Try some unique compliments like :
            "You can always make me laugh."
            "I love your style."
            "You make me a better person."
